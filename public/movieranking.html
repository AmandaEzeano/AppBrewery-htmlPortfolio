        <h1>The Best Movies According to Amanda</h1>

        <h2>My Top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
            <hr />

        
        <h3>Princess Diaries</h3>
            <p>I love this movie because it made me feel like being weird is okay, and you don't have to look perfect to be a Princess</p>
        
        <h3>Forest Gump</h3>
            <p>I like this one beacause it teaches perseverance and hardwork, even when one is limited physically and mentally</p>
        
        <h3>Black Panther</h3>
            <p>I like this because it gives back to black culture and promotes/normalizes black faces in the movie industry</p>
